## 🧪 Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Send friend request from expert card
- [ ] Accept incoming friend request
- [ ] Reject incoming friend request
- [ ] View friends list
- [ ] Remove friend from network
- [ ] Check friendship status updates
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile
- [ ] Verify authentication redirects
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios

### Edge Cases Handled
- **Duplicate Requests** - Prevents sending multiple requests to same user
- **Self-Requests** - Prevents users from sending requests to themselves
- **Network Errors** - Graceful handling of API failures
- **Empty States** - Proper messaging when no friends/requests exist

## 📋 Backend Requirements

### API Endpoints Needed
The frontend expects these Strapi v5 endpoints to be implemented:

```typescript
// Friend Requests
POST /api/friend-requests              // Send friend request
PUT /api/friend-requests/:id           // Accept/reject request
GET /api/friend-requests               // Get requests with filters

// Friends
GET /api/friends                       // Get friends list
DELETE /api/friends/:id                // Remove friend
```

### Data Models Required
- **Friend Request Collection** - Store pending requests
- **Friends Collection** - Store established friendships
- **User Model Extension** - Add friend request relations

See `STRAPI_FRIEND_SYSTEM_SPEC.md` for complete backend implementation details.
