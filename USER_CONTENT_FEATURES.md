# User Content Features

This document describes the implementation of user content creation and management features for the PropTelligence platform.

- **Financial Metrics**: Deal size, IRR, completion percentage
- **Role Management**: Select multiple roles (Developer, Investor, etc.)
- **Image Gallery**: Upload and manage property images
- **Headline Metrics**: Custom performance indicators

3. **Update**: Modify content using the same form interface
4. **Delete**: Use delete button with confirmation dialog
5. **Navigate**: Easy navigation between dashboard and forms

## Technical Implementation

  media_urls: ["image1.jpg", "image2.jpg"]
}
```

### Creating a Property
```typescript
// User navigates to /dashboard/create-property
// Fills out form with:
